pgDriveCheck
============

This is a in-house PeaceGeeks project to maintain a certain level of peace of mind when allowing large groups to use one Google drive.

This code will not run as is.  API keys and auth tokens have been removed store externally to the repo.  If I haven't yet, ping me to update
the README with information about setting that up yourself to use the Google Drive API.
